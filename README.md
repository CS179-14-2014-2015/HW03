#HW03 Compile Me (deadline: 2014-12-09)
===

Get `main.cpp` to compile and run.

The program uses the following libraries:

* [SDL2](http://wiki.libsdl.org/APIByCategory)
* [SDL2_gfx](http://cms.ferzkopp.net/index.php/software/13-sdl-gfx)

The program needs modifications to run (in particular, the `#include`s)

After getting it to run, you may add more stuff to it.
